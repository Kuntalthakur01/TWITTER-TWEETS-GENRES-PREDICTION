# Twitter Category Classification using NLP
This repository contains code for a machine learning project that focuses on classifying tweets into different categories using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
# Overview
The goal of this project is to build a classifier that can automatically categorize tweets into different categories based on their content. The categories that are currently supported include:
Politics
Sports
Entertainment
Technology
Business
The project uses a dataset of tweets that have been manually labeled with one of these categories. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, and several machine learning models are trained on the training set to classify the tweets. The best-performing model is then selected and evaluated on the test set.
# Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK
# Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook Twitter-Category-Classification.ipynb.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
# Results
The best-performing machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set. This is a promising result, but there is still room for improvement. Some possible directions for future work include:
Collecting more labeled data to improve the performance of the models.
Experimenting with different feature extraction techniques to see if they can improve the performance of the models.
Trying out different machine learning algorithms to see if they can achieve better performance than the ones used in this project.
